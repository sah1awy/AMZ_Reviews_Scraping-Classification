"Titanfall 2 is a dramatic symphony of astonishing mobility, exciting battles, and breath-taking mechanized battles. Its unique blend of pilot and Titan gameplay as well as the fact that its campaign and infinite multiplayer options are top-notch solidifies its position as a monumental achievement in the FPS genre. Would highly recommend!",5.0
"No other game can compare to this hidden gem! The campaign is amazing, fighting dinosaurs, traveling in time, controlling a giant mech, you can’t go wrong with it! Multiplayer is down? No worries, google Northstar TITANFALL and you’ll find the best community to play online, I own multiple copies of this and give them away to my friends!The More the Merrier!",5.0
But Also A Great Multiplayer Game If You Havent Already Give It A Chance Its Worth Playing A Least Once,5.0
The code is invalid! The code i received was 20 characters the code needed is 25 characters.,1.0
"If you enjoyed #1, you'll really enjoy this one.Combat is very similar to the original. Fast paced, love the wall running. Grappling hook and other abilities add some nice variety.Single player, while not groundbreaking is very nicely done. Only about 8 hours worth of gameplay there, very simplistic story, but the game is fun and the interactions between your titan and the pilot are enjoyable.Multiplayer is where this shines and it's better than the original. I docked one star because until the most recent update there was an issue with some PC systems where you could not play multiplayer without going through and adjusting your network settings (I've never had to do this for any other game). I think that's pretty unacceptable for a multiplayer focused PC game, however the new patch fixed that.",4.0
"Great first-person shooter with the addition of Mechs.  If you played the first Titanfall, Respawn listen to feedback and made changes to the core game to deliver a better game this time around. This is easily one of the best games I have played this year!  The game is smooth and feels fast but the system requirements are high with the minimum system specs for the video card at a GTX 1060 with 6gb vram.Many people have rated this low due to this game being a digital copy, not the actual game. The box art clearly shows that it is a digital copy only, no disc included. However, I agree the person making the add should have done a better job at including it in the written description as well. That is no reason to rate this game as a one-three stars for a sales description on Amazon that still shows it was a digital copy had you looked for it.",5.0
"This is probably my favorite game that I have played. The storyline, while short, is amazing storytelling, and makes you really love BT. The multiplayer is fast paced and extremely fun to play, as titans with masterful drivers can change the course of the battle. Camping is discouraged, as it is everything moves so fast. All guns can be bought with credits earned in game, or unlocked by levelling your pilot. Although SMGs are encouraged to use as they can kill faster, all the weapons in game are fun to use. Weapons like the Kraber, a 1 shot sniper, is incredibly hard to master, but when you do every kill is incredibly satisfying. At only $30, this is a steal, as all dlc is free, and the only purchases available are for skins. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is into shooters, and a fun single player campaign(albeit a short one).",5.0
"I see many people complaining about how this doesn't come with a physical disc. Well this is EA's new practice (just like Battlefield 1) and it says NO DISC on the top right of the cover art (dunno why it isn't emphasized in the description though)HOWEVER, you SHOULD order THIS version if:1. You are a Prime member. You save 20% on this ""physical"" version and pay only $47.99+tax. But you do need to wait for the shipment to actually arrive, so you generally cannot play the minute it is unlocked on Origin.2. You want to gift this to another person. A physical box containing a code is a better idea than just giving a code as a gift.3. You like to collect physical boxes of video games and display them on a bookshelf.I bought this version for reasons 1 and 3. It should be a no-brainer option for you if you are Prime.",5.0
"The single player campaign is fantastic in this new version of Titanfall. I really enjoyed the story and couldn't resist coming back to it until I had it beat. Graphics are great, gameplay is fun, you won't regret getting it! There are multiple in-game purchases for additional titans, paint kits, etc.Multiplayer game play has lots of progression by leveling your character, weapons, titans, earning banners and other such items via achievements.The only thing I think could use some refining is the way the multiplayer game sessions are chosen - it seems a bit slow at times taking a few minutes to get into a game. Also the ""happy hour"" bonuses only start very late at night so they're hard to take advantage of except on weekends.Overall a very good game!",4.0
"First, thank you Amazon for shipping it on release day. Secondly, I regret pre-ordering the game. I love Titanfall! I played the hell out if it and all of its DLCs, it had a fun and unique game-play and I was hoping for more in Titanfall 2. But Titanfall 2 Multiplayer was just a disappointment. I respect all of the Titanfall fans out there, so don't take it personally. I had high expectations, ignoring early reviews, and believing in Respawn to deliver another fun experience. Unfortunately, after finally receiving the game, and just to warm up, I highly enjoyed the short single player mode. However multiplayer was a disaster. Besides the core gameplay features such as wall sprinting, jet packs, and Titanfalls, everything that used to be fun has changed. Whether the change was pulled by Respawn or EA, I feel betrayed and deeply disappointing. As much as I try to forcefully accept and enjoy the game for what it is, I just can't play multiplayer the same way. For those of you who enjoy Call of Duty and Battlefield genres, this game may be appealing to you, but Titalfall is supposed to stand apart from those genres and introduce a different FPS experience. As far as the fans are concreted, I'm a huge Titanfall multiplayer fanatic and enjoyed what was fun and unique about Titanfall. If you're looking to have the same experience, reconsider buying this game now. Although I am a proponent in supporting the developers, the game not worth it's full price. I may jump back into multiplayer whenever a patch fixes it.",2.0
"This game goes on ridiculously low prices often $4 for example. The single-player game alone is worth this much. During the initial release, the multi-player was awesome. Wall running, mechs etc. Lots of fun. Can't comment on that though at the time of this writing. Again though, the SP campaign is definitely worth the often-run sale price.",5.0
"This game is getting a little older now, but I would still recommend you get it if you can find it for the $5 deal that happens occasionally.The multiplayer used to be awesome, and was used as the model for Apex Legends. The last few times I tried playing, I could not compete with the skill level of some of the people still playing it.That being said, the controls are spot on; the game feels good to play, whether with a controller or with M+K. The campaign was also really good. Not very long, but you will be entertained!I highly recommend picking this up for at least the campaign, which was surprisingly good, even in 2020.",5.0
"good game son really likes, I want to play but cant get him off, he is 4 yrs old and completed the single player and does multi but hard to find and join games, almost online dead already.  but action looks and plays nice I play a bit but cant get him off..... haha, really wish did not need origin though that is the problem it goes down a lot and is slow and really don't want it installed at all or running.  when origin is down cant play online , login etc.....",4.0
"I like this game because of the action, graphics and overall quality. However I was looking more for a mech warrior type game in which you are inside the mech and have more of operating a more machine type vehicle. It is fun to play although I don't think it is for me. I am still looking for a game more like mech wars, which is very dated now, enjoy.",3.0
"Great game, the campaing is totally worth the 5$ (This game sells for 5$ once a while... If it costs more atm just wait) price even though it's pretty short (~5 hours).It's a shooter combined with parkour mechanics.Can't really compare it to any game since I haven't played any similar game in the past. You have to experience it to understand.Don't buy it for the multiplayer though as it's pretty dead and once you finally find a server with players, it's usually hardcore players who play this game for years and that'll kill you just as you spawn.In my opinion this game is worth it just for the campaing (which is amazing!).",5.0
"Compared to Titanfall, this game has some improvements, including many new weapons, tactical abilities, titan chassis, and greater customization of pilot weapons and looks, as well as customization of the appearance of the titans. This game also has a few new maps, but none of the old ones, and a great story arc. I do dislike the lack of titan customization though, before I could take any given chassis, and its associated core, and put any weapon,  two kits, any ordnance, and any titan ability onto said chassis. Another problem is the faction system, before any player could be any rank and play in either faction, now all the new guys are in one faction, and you unlock more as you progress. I do wish this had some if not all of the old maps. On a positive not I do enjoy the new core abilities, they add some interesting game play, and everyone (least) favorite gun (Smart Pistol) is pretty much gone.",3.0
"This was a very good game to play, especially at the price. $3 for this game almost made it feel like a steal and if I knew how it would be I’d happily pay more. The story is captivating and the game has a lot of fun movements and weapons that separates it from most. It’s a bit hard to get into the game with other players but after a bit it’ll be fun and rewarding. If you are seriously looking into this game, I recommend looking at guides just to advance faster. Overall this is a very good game and I’d highly recommend it",5.0
"This is an awesome game that gave the players most of what they wanted from the old game, including a single player campaign that was rather well made that made you feel for a robot. The only downfall on the developers' side is the lack of a tertiary weapon; which will require you to decide on whether or not you want a sidearm or an anti-titan weapon. However, you have ~10 loadouts that are easy to switch in-game; so, with a little bit of planning, the hardship is easily recoverable [###EDIT this was returned in a later update].. The only other downside of the game is the rather low playerbase compared to other AAA titles despite stellar reviews [###EDIT promised content drops have greatly increased said playerbase].",5.0
"If you haven't played this, you're missing out. Great SP and MP. I'm not an FPS fan as much anymore and this still made my must play list.My son, whom I bought this copy for is addicted to this game. It is his favorite FPS hands-down. He loves titan battles, he loves the parkour, he loves the gunplay. They have a real gem of a game here, its a shame it didn't see more DLC and more SP content.Definitely buy this! And those coming from Apex wanting parkour and titans in your MP game, this is what you want!",5.0
"Just as the title reads! I purchased this game because it was on sale. As soon as I purchased it I went on the origin app and the code showed redeemed! I went on their website thinking it was an error and it was showing redeemed there too. When I contacted Amazon about they sent me to EA. When I went to EA they said they couldn't do anything and I needed to resolve with Amazon. I went back to amazon and Amazon referred to their technical support and after two weeks said issue was resolved and that I could use the code but when I went to use the code it was still having the same issue!could you believe that? How hard is it to re-issue a code or deactivate whoever redeemed the code that I purchased?Lesson learned though. EA AND/OR ORIGIN SUCKS. I'm 100% sure it was their error as they are the ones that generate the code.... but when you approach them they are unwilling to do anything to help! I even explained to their brilliant tech support guy that I purchased the code and so whoever is using it needs to be removed because it's mine with screenshots and everything!If you plan on purchasing any game that needs to be redeemed on origin, do not buy it on Amazon and consider buying it on origin instead. You may end up regretting it and pissing away two weeks like I did.",1.0
EA has extremely shady business tactics. For example... I purchased a game for download then was surprised to learn of all the mandatory extra steps needed before I could receive the product. They are not up front about the requirement of your personal information to receive your product upon purchase. EA purposefully hides the other multitude of steps that come after you complete your purchase. After setting up an account and all I still can not download the game without installing an app from EA.,1.0
"Totally lived up to my expectations.  Single player campaign was a bit short, but it was really good and actually very creative, I expected another run and gun shooter but there were numerous times that it blew my mind  (the time travel section is really awesome).Multiplayer is as fun as you would expect.. All in all, really good game, runs super fast too, feels nicely optimized.The only shame is that it was released at the same time as COD and Battlefield, which would of taken the spot light from this great game.  I don't know why publishers do that, this game should be been front end center for a few weeks at least.",5.0
"Great game. The campaign is beautiful, the multiplayer is addicting and fun. The only drawback to me is the lack of weapons to choose from, the lack of modifications for the weapons they do have, and how many maps they currently have available for multiplayer. I've played for about 10 hours now, and I'm already kind of sick of the maps, especially since some of them look very similar. Thankfully, there is no season pass for this game, so new maps will be available for free, and hopefully that will happen soon.",4.0
"Cheaper than download... you still have to download game *shrug* go figure, just contains the activation code, but I'm good with that and was willing to wait vs getting directly from EA.  I saved almost $20 - $30 from current EA purchase, but currently looks to be only saving $10... for $10, you might as well get the download.Great single player.  Some say short, but took me about 4-5hours to finish... I'm good with that.  Haven't played multiplayer yet, but its been fun.",4.0

"As a serious fan of Titanfall 1, I had to buy this game once it went on sale.I think I got it for $30 USD.  I played it for a couple hundred hours within the first month of getting it, even though I had to play it on low quality settings, on Bootcamp with a MacBook Pro.This game has made me seriously consider building/buying a gaming rig.I don't regret a thing.",4.0
"while this has got to be one of the single most enjoyable shooters I own, a fair warning to anyone coming in new to the franchise like me, there will be a steep learning curb. So expect to be killed in almost every way possible for your first few matches. However after getting a hang of the movement and combat system, (which may I say is fluid and incredibly satisfying once you master it), the game easily outshines most other shooters on the market, and actually feels like a break from the repetitive game play that studios like activision continue to release.",5.0
"Seriously, why have you not bought this as yet?Is it an FPS? a platformer? a mind blowing time travelling mech smashing romp with personality and wonderful storytelling chops?How about all 3!!!!!Yes and if you purchase now because you were too lazy to support it on launch, you can get it for the low low price of Four Ninety NIIIIIINE!!!!Buy it, even if just for the single player campaign, it is so worth it!!!!Note, download is around 50gbs, so prep your isp for pain.",5.0
"All of TF made better. Great single player. Deep, strategic multi-player. And the worst matchmaking ever. Already there aren't enough players, so prepare to join teams with noobs against leet multi-gen players, VIPs, and PROs. Hard to learn how to get better with these types of match-ups. Hard to want to spend the time needed. Yet, I love the game just like I loved TF.  That game, however, was one you could slowly work your way up in and feel real accomplishment.  In TF2 I progress, but I really don't become a better player. Argh. Still playing because of love, but I feel the hate rising.",3.0
"I had already purchased this on PS4 when it came out, but I couldn't pass up the $4.99 sale price for a PC copy. Titanfall 2 is an amazing FPS - fast paced action, fun weapons and titans, and a fantastic story campaign. If you can get the game on sale I would 100% grab it, the online community is still very active and there's a lot of matches running.",5.0
"Titanfall 2 has a pretty interesting and fun single player, which somehow feels reminiscent of Half-Life 2. But sadly it's far too short. The multiplayer just seems boring and way too small to me. As someone who is more of a Battlefield player, I was shocked at how small the matches are in this game. The biggest I saw was 8/8! Compare that to 32/32 in BF1. I enjoyed the SP but felt no interest in the MP. Maybe I'm old school but I really wish for a much longer single player experience. Game is okay I guess, but not my cup of tea.",3.0
"This game is a blast. It's so good, I actually bought it for a friend (which is rare). It does an excellent job of introducing new movement capabilities and abilities, and the levels are so varied. Between the assembly line level, and the ""Effect and Cause"" level, it's just a fun breath of fresh air that may seem short but is well worth it.Highly recommended.",5.0
The campaign is short but solid. It has new ideas and concept being thrown your way from beginning to end and never gets stale. Every character is unique and likable with the Titan BT being quite a personality. The online multiplayer is polished to a mirror shine. Stealing batteries from an enemy titan and running away with it to place it on a friendly titan and give it extra health and a shield is fun. And the extra layers offered by perks and different pilot abilities gives the game play enough depth.,5.0
"Very fluid game play and everything is pretty balanced. Except the ""Tone"" titan. That one is really overpowered. There are not a ton of maps, but there are enough that you are not constantly playing the same three maps. There really are not too many weapons, and some categories are seriously lacking (Shotguns). Some guns have actual bullet drop, so that makes sniping harder and a lot more challenging but also much more rewarding. The sub-machine guns are really good would suggest them. Assault rifles do more damage but dont fire as fast.",5.0
"I love it! The game is fast, no time for thinking. It has a lot of customization but not P2W. The gameplay is great and the max time I have been waiting for a match is less than one minute. One of the most fun games I've played in recent years.",4.0
"We've got pilots and titans, all running with jetpacks.Fire ammunition and punching melee attacks.Wall running, map hacks, and evil AI beings.These are a few of my favorite things ~Titanfall 2 is by far one of the best FPS games I've played in a while. A solid mix of the original Unreal Tournament, meets Tribes, meets Mech Warrior - it has a solid bit of everything. The campaign is how a shooter should play, and the multiplayer completely on point. So far, it's my 2016 game of the year.",5.0
"I haven't put much time into the Multiplayer side of this game but I'm giving it a 5 based on the Singleplayer alone. The only other game to come out this year that comes close to being as fun and crazy as this is DOOM but its for entirely different reasons. The small amount of MP I did play was fun but given that I've been playing R6: Siege, a significantly slower paced game, for the past year I have a hard time playing this.Quality game would definitely recommend.",5.0
"One of the best this year! The campaign gives a solid story and experience that introduces new players to the universe and offers some references to the previous game that fans will appreciate. It took me around 6-7 hours on hard difficulty.The multiplayer offers a host of new unlocks and more weapons compared to the fisrt game and they all feel unique. Titans are now in a class system that allows for some interesting counterplay. Best thing is that all map, weapon, and titan DLC will come free for everyone!!",5.0
"The single player campaign had a boring story with lackluster characters, but, it was a very fun experience.the multiplayer has been fun (even when I'm losing horribly), but, it is very difficult to understand what I'm supposed to accomplish with each mission.However, it I don't mind being confused because the game is very fun.",4.0
"It's a great product that actually adds more to what the original titan fall was supposed to have, theres a great story and many the titan BT, feels like a great and loyal companion, and at some moments even like a good friend. It's a shame how this game doesn't really get the attention and praise it deserves.",4.0
"Great single player experience to introduce the mechanics of the pilot and titan(s) to those who haven't played the first game. Even if it seems a bit short, it still was entertaining enough, and had some new tricks in it that I haven't seen before in a FPS game. Multiplayer is a ton of fun, and after playing through the single player campaign, you'll be good to go without being overwhelmed. Overall solid game that's good for 15 minute sessions to hour long binges, and everything in between.",5.0
"Campaign is absolutely phenomenal 10/10. Its very clear they put tons of hours into developing it and making it enjoyable and lasting. However, the issues start to appear in the MultiplayerMultiplayer: All guns are like a 1 second kill. No sense of variation or enjoyment. You kill, you die, rinse and repeat. Along with that, gathering currency to unlock new items takes wayyy too long. Finally, and the most unfortunate, the multiplayer player base is practically dead. US East and I have 0 players for a different gamemode. Disappointing and unfortunate.",3.0
"Solid campaign, albeit a bit on the short side.  Multiplayer is good.  Big mechs and wall running!At this time, Private Matches are 'beta', 8v8 max, and no XP progression.Currently there is no Frontier Defense mode.  (coop vs AI)edit: July 2017 - Frontier Defense Mode is finally being added this month!",4.0
"Titanfall 2 is an enjoyable game. The campaign is short but really well done and a great introduction to the mechanics of the game.  High-speed gameplay, you feel sluggish playing other games after playing Titanfall. The multiplayer is great and very replayable. The attrition multiplayer mode is my favorite part of the game.",5.0
"The single player campaign was excellent, albeit a little short. Surprising especially when you consider it's published by EA. I love the Frontier Defense multiplayer mode, but it can take up to 5 minutes to find a match (I recommend customizing your pilot and titan while you wait.). It's unfortunate that this game was overshadowed by others that came around at the same time, it's really well polished and optimized for PC.",5.0

"I have played titanfall 2 for a couple days now and I can confidently say this is definitely one of the most underrated games I have played. Love the mechanics, load out customization and still has a strong player base. If you want a break from call of duty or battlefield then look no further",5.0
"This game is so intense and exciting nearly every second of every moment in multiplayer, fun and absolutely chaotic, my only gripe is the game is not as graphically impressive as some of its competition like Battlefield 1, even so I'd fully recommend this game if you like well done fast paced gaming.",4.0
Okay....I screwed up.....The first time I tried this game after installation it just would not load causing my computer to crash....I was kinda upset since this was my 2nd EA game that refused to cooperate......Finally I realized that my High Def...video monitor was the problem - once I adjusted the resolution out of the stratosphere the game plays flawlessly .....Soooooooo.........Sorry for flaming EA and Origin ....It actually seems to be a fantastic shooter.....Nothing appears to be wrong with it except a slightly dumb operator!!!,5.0
"Incredible game honestly. Movement feels very fluid for an FPS - great intuitive wallrunning, grapple hooking around the map... Decently optimized and not pay to win. Great single player campaign imo - kind of like Halo but not quite so backed by lore like Halo does with it's long book series, would 100% recommend picking up when on sale, and this game seems to go on sale a lot.",5.0
"This game is really fun to play. Really underrated and it has pretty solid campaign as well. Multiplayer is really fun, but the community that plays it is getting smaller(It wasn't massive to begin with). EA pretty much shafted this game on release due to a pretty bad release window.",5.0
"love it! didn't bother buying the first one because it didn't have a story mode/ campaign mode. this one does and it is great, however the story mode is short. if you are someone who enjoys the giant robot genre, i highly recommend the game.

I've been sitting on buying Titanfall for...a long time. I can't believe I waited. The campaign is some of the most fun I've had in a long time and the multiplayer is better than anything you'll get with Call of Duty. I'm 100% serious. Buy this game yesterday.,5.0
"Please be aware when you buy this product you will not be downloading it through Amazon. You will be downloading it through Origin which is Electronic Arts (EA) download service and client.

The second time the download progressed to 13% and then failed but fortunately I was able to continue from that point.

"Wow can't believe I waited so long to get this game. I don't play multi but the solo campaign is so much fun. I'm 4 hours into the game and I don't want the game to end. Playing in 4k with no lag. Beautiful, the robots feel heavy, the weapon selection is huge and the sound is perfect.",5.0
"I got the game when it was listed for 4.99, and I absolutely adore this game. I wish i had paid more for it, but nonetheless it was well worth the price",5.0
"Epic, fast paced shooter with awesome environments, the best single player since Doom 2016, tight controls, good acting, whose only downful is a typically short single player campaign. Asymmetric play that allows you to control a massive mech one minute or flying from building to building like a ninja the next! I just wished they hadn't sandwiched it between the heavy hitters.",5.0
I don't know what's going on. I'm getting a Direct X installation error for this game & the Mass effect Trio on 3 PC's I have.I've put a ticket in & waiting for a call back from Customer Support with hope they can assist me via Remote assistance.All 3 of my Systems are updated & have Direct X 12 compliant GPU's. it seems these games that you must download & install using Origin have problems Downloading & installing the correct Direct X run time routine. They expect you to go into your registry & fix it on your own.This is unacceptable to me. I'm not happy.,2.0
"This has to be one of the best first person shooters I've ever played. The story, writing, voice acting, extremely fun gameplay - all deliver.",5.0
Game is a lot of fun. One of my favorite FPS games. I'll take this game over Call of Duty or even Battlefield. I definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested.,4.0
"Tbh this game came out in the wrong time. Too much competition during that time, but I managed to get it for a bit over $5 and loved every second of it. I spent lots of time in practice trying to beat the AI xD",5.0
"Game looks beautiful, but really gets boring quickly... I played this on my playstation 4 and pc and really do not care for it as much as I thought I would. It runs great and looks great, but just doesn't draw me in at all..",3.0
Incredible game! I love the platform aspects of this fps and the unique play styles. There's so much strategy. The single-player story is killer and worth it for $20. The online multiplayer is awesome if you don't mind dying a lot until you start learning how to go super fast.,5.0
Wow what a fun game. Fast pace balls to the walls. The campaign was stellar and great pace with a story that was compelling and I cared for the characters. The multiplayer game is much better then the first. It's more polished and better balanced. One of the best games this year by far.,5.0
Single player campaign is great but multiplayer was plagued with issues early on (released same week as BF1) and the player base has been in a constant decline.,4.0
NICE,4.0
I enjoy the FPS and mech combat. The story is cool. Some of the jump puzzles detract from my gaming experience because I get stuck at a checkpoint. I bought the game for the story and the combat not to get stuck on jump puzzles.,3.0
"Good game, awesome single player, short but really well designed.  Wish multiplayer is still popular, but game's been out a while so not much ppl on now.",5.0
"One of the best FPS games I've played. Small learning curve but once you get the hang of it, it is insanely fun. The single player campaign is awesome and the multiplayer is great with several different game modes. Plus, you fight in giant robots. Can't recommend this game enough.",5.0
"Good single player campaign, multiplayer has the usual modes you'd expect from a AAA game.",4.0
You need this. I promise.  Amazing single player and even if its short its always super fun to go back to. Multiplayer is fun too.,5.0
"Titanfall 2 was very underrated when it came out. The campaign is top-notch, there are still online matches as of March 2018... Respawn is the only company or group from within the E.A. structure that I will buy a title from anymore.",5.0
"I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. The combat is fast with lots of ways to traverse the map, the different pilot types add great variety, and the titans are super fun.The game is good enough for me to overlook that it's EA and Origin, that's how good it is.",5.0
"Amazing game, highly underrated, 10/10 would bounce on my boy's Northstar again. The gameplay is fluid, which is definitely my fetish, and the singleplayer campaign is amazing. It focuses on discount Optimus Prime and his new boyfriend, space McCree going on a sick adventure to kill stuff.",5.0
"Great game for PC, usually these titles are for other platforms.  Great gameplay, but surprised by how short the single player mode is.",4.0
"Buy it, the campaign is not long but excellent.The graphic are beautifully done and options menu it wonderful for all builds.Definielty give it a try, it is worth it.",5.0
havent played it online but totally worth just playing for the awesome single player story.,4.0
"No trouble installing, or using the game. Gameplay is excellent, and very challenging. I bought it because it has a solo campaign, as I don't play these games online. Well Done EA! Bring out TF3 soon.",5.0
"I dislike the fact that I paid money for this game, but I can't access it or request a refund.",1.0
"Awesome single player campaign, haven't tried multiplayer as I've read it's dead. The single player alone is worth it, can't think of a better legal way to spend 5$.",5.0
