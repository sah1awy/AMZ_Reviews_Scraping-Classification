# Reviews Classification

Project Overview
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Explore and clean the Kaggle dataset.  
Model Training: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.  
Data Scraping: Scrape data from Amazon to test the model's performance on new, real-world data.  
Model Testing: Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance on the scraped Amazon data.  
Dataset Information  
Kaggle Dataset  
Source: Kaggle  

  
Description: The dataset contains various features relevant to the project's goal (e.g., product reviews, ratings).
Usage: Used for training the machine learning model.
Amazon Scraped Data
Source: Amazon website
Description: Scraped data includes real-world product reviews and ratings.
Usage: Used for testing the trained model.
Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Load Data: Import the Kaggle dataset.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and preprocess text data (if applicable).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data distributions, correlations, and key statistics.
Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary and select relevant features for model training.
Model Training
Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, etc.).
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
Model Training: Train the model on the training set and validate it on the validation set.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters for better performance.
Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Amazon Data Scraping
Web Scraping Setup: Use tools like BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape product reviews and ratings from Amazon.
Data Collection: Gather a sufficient amount of data for testing.
Data Cleaning: Clean the scraped data to match the format of the Kaggle dataset.
Model Testing
Preprocess Scraped Data: Apply the same preprocessing steps used on the Kaggle data.
Predict: Use the trained model to predict outcomes on the scraped Amazon data.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance on the new data and compare it with the validation results.
Conclusion
Summarize the project's findings, the model's performance on both datasets, and any challenges faced during the process. Discuss potential improvements and future work.
